    "I think, therefore I am" is a philosophical statement by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes">Ren√© Descartes</a>, suggesting that the very act of thinking is proof of one's existence. Therefore for us to life we must first think, and what better way to think than to learn new things such as programming!
